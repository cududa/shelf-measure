What I'm building
	•	I've built a freestanding pipe bookshelf using threaded steel pipe.
	•	Each shelf:
	•	30” long
	•	12” deep
	•	On each shelf level:
	•	There’s a left vertical pipe and a right vertical pipe
	•	The shelf rests directly on horizontal pipe runs on the left and right
	•	The shelf does not overhang the pipes enough to self-index or resist sliding

⸻

Pipe geometry (important)
	•	Pipe outside diameter: ~1.074”
	•	Circumference: ~3.375”
	•	Distance between left/right pipes is not perfectly consistent because:
	•	I cut and threaded the pipe myself
	•	Example measured clear span: 28 31/32” (~28.97”)
	•	Because of this variability:
	•	The shelf cannot rely on a tight friction fit
	•	The shelf needs mechanical indexing to stay centered and not drift

⸻

What the brackets are doing
	•	I'm using flat steel plates screwed to the underside of the shelf
	•	Each plate has:
	•	Countersunk holes
	•	Brass acorn nuts on the bolts (or similar)
	•	Those brass nuts contact the outside faces of the vertical pipes
	•	Result:
	•	The shelf drops into place
	•	The nuts “hug” the pipes laterally
	•	The shelf can’t slide left/right once seated
	•	Gravity + lateral contact = stability without visible hardware on top

This is basically a hidden anti-racking / anti-slip locator, not a load-bearing bracket — which is exactly the right mental model.

⸻

Key constraints
	•	The brackets:
	•	Don’t need to carry vertical load
	•	Do need to resist shear / lateral movement
	•	Placement matters because:
	•	Pipe spacing varies slightly per shelf
	•	I need tolerance, not a press-fit
	•	Brass nuts touching pipe:
	•	Prevent wood-on-metal abrasion
	•	Allow a bit of forgiveness vs steel-on-steel

All of this checks out mechanically and practically.

Where we’ll go next
The next logical steps are:
	1.	Decide how much lateral play I want (intentional tolerance)
	2.	Translate pipe diameter → nut contact geometry
	3.	Determine:
	•	Distance from shelf edge → bracket plate
	•	Hole placement on the plate relative to the pipe centerline
	4.	Account for:
	•	Wood movement
	•	Slight pipe misalignment
